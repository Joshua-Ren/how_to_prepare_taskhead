# how_to_prepare_taskhead

Thanks very much for interesting in our work and sorry for this empty github repository. 
The fundamental algorithm is quite easy to implement: just stop the linear probing earlier far from converge.
The code used for our experiments would be released soon (I guess it should be ready before the end of April, sorry for the procrastination ...) But the algorithm is really simple, so why not look deeper into the proofs for the toy model :-)
